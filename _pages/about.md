I am currently a 3rd-year PhD student at the [Terrier Team](http://terrierteam.dcs.gla.ac.uk/index.html) within the [Glasgow Information Retrieval Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/#), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), supervised by Dr [Craig Macdonald](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm/) and Professor [Iadh Ounis](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/).
My recent research interest is mainly about **Conversational Recommendation in E-commerce**. In particular, I mainly focus on four things:
- **multi-modality**: extracting the feature representations from both the system's visual recommendations and the users' natural-language feedback,
- **dialog management**: tracking/estimating the users' preferences over time and specialising dialog policy with reinforcement learning,
- **interpretability**: what are the factors that affect the effectiveness of the conversational recommendation models.
- **user simulator**: leveraging the simulation techniques for imitating the users' feedback for training and evaluation 

My study is funded by the [Closed Loop Data Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/closedloop/) Project and the [Computing Science Excellence Bursary](https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/schoolofcomputingscienceinternationalexcellenceawards/).
